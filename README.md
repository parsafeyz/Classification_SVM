# Support Vector Machine (SVM) Classifier ðŸ§ âœ¨

[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/parsafeyz/Classification_SVM/blob/main/SVM_v1.ipynb)

This notebook explores how to use **Support Vector Machines (SVM)** with the RBF kernel to build a classifier using scikit-learn. Perfect for those looking to level up their ML game with a clean and classic algorithm. ðŸ’»ðŸ“Š

## ðŸš€ Features

- Loads and preprocesses a dataset using `pandas` and `sklearn.preprocessing`
- Splits the data into training and test sets using `train_test_split`
- Trains an SVM classifier with the **RBF kernel**
- Evaluates performance using:
  - Confusion Matrix (with a cute visualization ðŸŽ¨)
  - F1 Score
  - Jaccard Index

## ðŸ§© Libraries Used

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from sklearn import preprocessing, svm
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.metrics import classification_report, confusion_matrix, f1_score, jaccard_score
